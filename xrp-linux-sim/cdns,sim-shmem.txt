Bindings for the Cadence Xtensa simulator shared memory.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "cdns,sim-shmem".
- reg: register locations of each shared memory block.
- exit-loc: exit register location.
- reg-names: string list, one string per shared memory block: name of the
             shared memory region usable for opening it with shm_open. The
             name may contain printf-like format specifier for an int
             parameter, if it's present it's substituted with the PID of the
             process.

Example:


	sim-shmem {
		compatible = "cdns,sim-shmem";
		reg = <0xf0000000 0x08000000
		       0x00000000 0x10000000>;
		exit-loc = <0xf0000108>;
		reg-names = "SharedRAM_L.%d", "SystemRAM_L.%d";
	};
