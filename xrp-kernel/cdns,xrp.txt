Bindings for the Cadence Xtensa Remote Processing driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "cdns,xrp".
- reg: register locations of the DSP MMIO block, DSP communication area and
  DSP shared memory area.

Optional properties:
- device-irq: 3 32-bit cells:
  - first: offset of the 32-bit device IRQ MMIO register from the DSP MMIO
    block start;
  - second: register bit index that controls IRQ;
  - third: DSP IRQ number (normal core IRQ number, not external IRQ number)
    controlled by this register/bit.
- device-irq-mode: 0 for none (polling), 1 for level, 2 for edge.

- host-irq: 2 32-bit cells:
  - first: offset of the 32-bit device IRQ MMIO register from the DSP MMIO
    block start;
  - second: register bit index that controls IRQ.
- host-irq-mode: 0 for none (polling), 1 for level, 2 for edge.
- interrupts: host IRQ number controlled by this register/bit.

- firmware-name: string identifying firmware name. If missing "xvp.elf" is
  used.

- #address-cells: number of cells DSP physical address takes in the ranges.
- #size-cells: number of cells each size takes in the ranges.
- ranges: standard ranges property. Provides mapping of DSP physical addresses
  to host physical addresses. Arbitrary number of groups with the following
  structure:
  - cells with DSP physical address of the region;
  - cells with the corresponding host physical address of the
    region;
  - cells with the size of the region.

Example:

	xvp@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "cdns,xrp";
		reg = <0xfd001000 0x00000200
		       0xf0000000 0x00001000
		       0xf0001000 0x00fff000>;
		device-irq = <0 1 5>; /* offset, bit#, IRQ# */
		device-irq-mode = <1>;
		host-irq = <0xfffff000 0>; /* offset, bit# */
		host-irq-mode = <2>;
		interrupts = <15 0>;
		firmware-name = "xrp0.elf";
		ranges = <0x00000000 0x00000000 0x10000000
			  0x3ffc0000 0xc0000000 0x00020000
			  0x3ffe0000 0xc0020000 0x00020000
			  0x50000000 0x50000000 0x01000000
			  0x60000000 0x60000000 0x20000000
			  0xf0000000 0xf0000000 0x0d000000>;
	};
