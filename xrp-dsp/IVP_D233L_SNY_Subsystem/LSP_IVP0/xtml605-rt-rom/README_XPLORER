About memmap.xmm
----------------

WARNING: The memmap.xmm file in this lsp will NOT be updated with latest changes. 

The memory map editor saves changes only to sim/memmap.xmm.
This is intentional because the clone config is treated as a "set of standard lsps" with a single memory map. 
Other lsps such as sim-rom, min-rt, represent different target platforms, 
differing from sim in the parameters they use (such as ROMING=true, ENTRY=symbol, etc).

Since the memmap.xmm files of other lsps are siblings of sim/memmap.xmm, 
we generate only linker scripts for the other lsps by asking xt-genldscripts 
to read the memory partition info from sim/memmap.xmm and parameters from other lsps.

So if user creates a "clone config for editing memory map", the memmap.xmm files for lsps apart from sim 
will not be updated, only their linker scripts will be generated. 

Also, these linker scripts will be generated lazily by the makefile, 
when this lsp is used as a part of a managed xtensa c/c++ project. 
If you plan to use this lsp in an unmanaged project, i.e. a project where makefiles are written by you, 
please generate all lsps using the menuitem "Generate linker scripts" on the context menu of the clone config,
before building the project.

However, if you want to create a new lsp for your target platform, Xplorer has a new feature called "Custom LSP". 
You can create a custom lsp by copying one of the standard lsps (sim, gdbio, min-rt, etc.) as a starting point, 
and then modify this custom lsp as per the requirements of your target platform.

The custom lsp is now de-linked from the standard lsps, and you can independently make changes to it 
through the memory map editor. Any changes will be saved to <new_custom_lsp>/memmap.xmm, 
and its linker scripts will be generated. 

To create a custom lsp, select an installed build, right click and click the menuitem "Create Custom LSP".
 
Please read the help at Concepts -> "Memory Map and Custom LSP" for more details.
